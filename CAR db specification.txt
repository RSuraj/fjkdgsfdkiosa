28.	CLIMATE_CTRL		:		CLIMATE CONTROL(EXPENSIVE THAN AC) SMART, IF WE SET 23C COMPTER SENSORS IS USED TO MAINTAIN IT, NO CHANGE EVEN THE TEMP OUT SIDE IS -10 OR +45
29.	CENTRAL_LOCK		:		CENTRAL LOCKING; ALL DOORS ARE LOCKED/OPENED WHEN DRIVER SIDE DOOR IS LOCKED/OPENED. IN KEY LESS SYSTEM, THIS IS DONE USING REMOTE CONTROL
30.	CD_PLAYER			:
31.	POWER_STEERING		:		HYDRAULIC OR ELECTRIC ACTUATORS ADD CONTROLLED ENERGY TO THE STEERING MECHANISM, SO THE DRIVER CAN PROVIDE LESS EFFOR TO TURN THE STEERING WHEELS. IT IS CONSIDERABLY EFFECTIVE VEHICLE IS STOPPED OR MOVING SLOWLY.
32. POWER_WINDOWS		:		WINDOWS WHICH CAN BE RAISED OR LOWERED BY DEPRESSING A BUTTON OR SWITCH
33. STEERING_ADJ_RAKE	: 		STEERING ADJUSTMENT RAKE; ABILITY TO ADJUST THE STEERING POSITION(UP/DOWN)
34.	STEERING_ADJ_REACH	:		STEERING ADJUSTMENT REACH; ABILITY SET THE STEEING POSITION USING A LEVER UNDERNEATH THE STEERING.
35.	E_ADJ_D_SEAT		:		ELECTRICALLY ADJUSTABLE DRIVER SEAT; ABILITY TO ADJUST DRIVER SEAT BY USING A SWITCH OR JOYSTICK
36.	STEEING_M_C			:		STEERING MOUNTED CONTROLS; CONTROL BUTTONS MOUNTED ON STEERING WHEELS FOR VARIUS PURPOSES LIKE AUDIO CONTROL
